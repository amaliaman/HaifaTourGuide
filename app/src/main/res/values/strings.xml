        These gardens, located in the heart of Haifa, comprise a staircase of nineteen terraces
        extending all the way up the northern slope of Mount Carmel. The golden-domed Shrine of
        the Báb, the resting place of the Prophet-Herald of the Bahá’í Faith, stands on the central
        terrace, looking across the bay towards ‘Akko.
        \nWhile different parts of the gardens offer a variety of experiences, they speak in a
        common language of graveled paths, hedges and flower beds groomed and nurtured by dedicated
        gardeners. The gardens frame panoramic views of the city, the Galilee Hills and the
        Mediterranean Sea.

    <string name="carmelite_description">
        The present Stella Maris Carmelite Monastery was built in 1836 and is noted for its lush
        frescoes portraying St. Elijah. The interior also contains paintings of scenes of the lives
        of the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel and has a cedar figurine of the Virgin known as the
        Madonna of Mt. Carmel. The Carmelite order was founded on Mount Carmel in 1150 as a
        hermetic Catholic sect.
        \nWhen the order sided with Napoleon during his battle against the Ottoman Turks in 1799,
        the Carmelite monasteries were destroyed. In front of the building is the tomb of the
        French soldiers who were killed during the battle. Afterwards, this monastery was rebuilt
        but was again razed in 1821 by the pasha of Akko (Acre). A small but interesting museum is
        in a room adjoining the monastery entrance. From the monastery, a trail leads down to the
        grotto known as Elijah\'s cave, believed to be either the one-time dwelling place or tomb
        of Elijah.

        it exhibits themes related to the core of the city and its character, which attract different cultures,
        and encounters between the east and the west. The museum thus opens a space for debating political
        issues that are formed and processed within the urban space.
        \nThe museum not only explores the unique story of Haifa within the local landscape, but also
        promotes a discourse revolving around the urban space and the urban culture as an object of research.

        The Mané-Katz Museum resides at Panorama Road, and overlooks the stunning landscape of the bay
        of Haifa. The museum opened in 1977, at the home of Mané-Katz, where the artist lived and created
        during the last years of his life. In 1958, Mané-Katz bequeathed his entire estate and collections
        to the municipality of Haifa. In August 2010, Mané-Katz Museum, which until then operated as part
        of the municipality of Haifa, was transferred to the management of Haifa Museums under the management
        of Ms. Noa Tarshis. In November, the Municipality of Haifa allocated the museum a budget to restore
        the building. The museum opened its doors again to the public on April 9th 2011. The building’s overall
        renovations included renovating the showrooms and the foundations, adding new offices and a museum shop,
        and establishing a café on the balcony overlooking the magical scenery of Haifa’s bay. When the renovations
        were completed, elegant exhibitions spaces, which made it possible to properly exhibit Mané-Katz works and
        collections, were fashioned.
